## Movie database 

This is my basic movie database CRUD app using Laravel and Vue. 

## Getting Started

The database used while developing was an sqlite database. To set this up when running locally navigate to the project root folder ann run:

```
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Then run the migrations and you should be ready to go!
